    "# Deep Learning for Text Sequences\n",
    "\n",
    "We will explore deep-learning models that can process text (understood as sequences of word or sequences of characters), timeseries, and sequence data in general. The two fundamental deep-learning algorithms for sequence processing are **recurrent neural networks** and **1D convnets**, the one-dimensional version of the 2D convnets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Applications of these algorithms include the following:\n",
    " - Document classification and timeseries classification, such as identifying the topic of an article or the author of a book\n",
    " - Timeseries comparisons, such as estimating how closely related two documents or two stock tickers are\n",
    " - Sequence-to-sequence learning, such as decoding an English sentence into French\n",
    " - Sentiment analysis, such as classifying the sentiment of tweets or movie reviews as positive or negative\n",
    " - Timeseries forecasting, such as predicting the future weather at a certain location, given recent weather data\n",
    " \n",
    "### Working with Text Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Text is one of the most widespread forms of sequence data. It can be understood as either a sequence of characters or a sequence of words, but it’s most common to work at the level of words. The deep-learning sequence-processing models can use text to produce a basic form of natural-language understanding, sufficient for applications including document classification, sentiment analysis, author identification, and even question-answering (QA) (in a constrained context). \n",
    "\n",
    "None of the deeplearning models truly understand text in a human sense; rather, these models can map the statistical structure of written language, which is sufficient to solve many simple textual tasks. Deep learning for natural-language processing is pattern recognition applied to words, sentences, and paragraphs, in much the same way that computer vision is pattern recognition applied to pixels.\n",
    "\n",
    "Like all other neural networks, deep-learning models don’t take as input raw text: they only work with numeric tensors. **Vectorizing** text is the process of transforming text into numeric tensors. This can be done in multiple ways:\n",
    " - Segment text into words, and transform each word into a vector.\n",
    " - Segment text into characters, and transform each character into a vector.\n",
    " - Extract n-grams of words or characters, and transform each n-gram into a vector. **N-grams** are overlapping groups of multiple consecutive words or characters.\n",
    " \n",
    "Collectively, the different units into which we can break down text (words, characters, or n-grams) are called **tokens**, and breaking text into such tokens is called **tokenization**. All text-vectorization processes consist of applying some tokenization scheme and then associating numeric vectors with the generated tokens. These vectors, packed into sequence tensors, are fed into deep neural networks. There are multiple ways to associate a vector with a token. Two major ones: ***one-hot\n",
    "encoding of tokens*** , and ***token embedding (typically used exclusively for words, and called\n",
    "word embedding)***.\n",

    "#### Understanding n-grams and bag-of-words\n",
    "Word n-grams are groups of N (or fewer) consecutive words that we can extract from a sentence. The same concept may also be applied to characters instead of words. Here’s a simple example. Consider the sentence “The cat sat on the mat.” It may be\n",
    "decomposed into the following set of 2-grams:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{\"The\", \"The cat\", \"cat\", \"cat sat\", \"sat\",```\n",
    "\n",
    "```\"sat on\", \"on\", \"on the\", \"the\", \"the mat\", \"mat\"}```\n",
    "\n",
    "It may also be decomposed into the following set of 3-grams:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{\"The\", \"The cat\", \"cat\", \"cat sat\", \"The cat sat\",```\n",
    "\n",
    "```\"sat\", \"sat on\", \"on\", \"cat sat on\", \"on the\", \"the\",```\n",
    "\n",
    "```\"sat on the\", \"the mat\", \"mat\", \"on the mat\"}```\n",
    "\n",
    "Such a set is called a ***bag-of-2-grams*** or ***bag-of-3-grams***, respectively. The term bag here refers to the fact that you’re dealing with a set of tokens rather than a list or sequence: the tokens have no specific order. This family of tokenization methods is called bag-of-words.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because bag-of-words isn’t an order-preserving tokenization method (the tokens generated are understood as a set, not a sequence, and the general structure of the sentences is lost), it tends to be used in shallow language-processing models rather than in deep-learning models. Extracting n-grams is a form of feature engineering, and deep learning does away with this kind of rigid, brittle approach, replacing it with hierarchical feature learning. One-dimensional convnets and recurrent neural networks,are capable of learning representations for groups of words and characters without being explicitly told about the existence of such groups, by looking at continuous word or character sequences. \n",
    "\n",
    "### One-hot Encoding of Words and Characters\n",
    "One-hot encoding is the most common, most basic way to turn a token into a vector. It consists of associating a unique integer index with every word and then turning this integer index ***i*** into a binary vector of size ***N (the size of the\n",
    "vocabulary)***; the vector is all zeros except for the ***i*** th entry, which is ***1***.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, one-hot encoding can be done at the character level, as well. To unambiguously drive home what one-hot encoding is and how to implement it, below are two toy examples: one for words, the other for characters\n",

    "A variant of one-hot encoding is the so-called **one-hot hashing trick**, which we can use when the number of unique tokens in our vocabulary is too large to handle explicitly. Instead of explicitly assigning an index to each word and keeping a reference of these indices in a dictionary, we can hash words into vectors of fixed size. This is typically done with a very lightweight hashing function. The main advantage of this method is that it does away with maintaining an explicit word index, which saves memory and allows online encoding of the data (we can generate token vectors right away, before we’ve seen all of the available data). The one drawback of this approach is that it’s susceptible to **hash collisions**: two different words may end up with the same hash, and subsequently any machine-learning model looking at these hashes won’t be able to tell the difference between these words. The likelihood of hash collisions decreases when the dimensionality of the hashing space is much larger than the total number of unique tokens being hashed.\n",

Whereas the vectors obtained through one-hot encoding are *binary, sparse (mostly made of zeros), and very high-dimensional* (same dimensionality as the number of words in the vocabulary), word embeddings are low dimensional floating-point vectors (that is, dense vectors, as opposed to sparse vectors). Unlike the word vectors obtained via one-hot encoding, word\n",
    "embeddings are learned from data. It’s common to see word embeddings that are 256-dimensional, 512-dimensional, or 1,024-dimensional when dealing with very large vocabularies. On the other hand, one-hot encoding words generally leads to vectors\n",
    "that are 20,000-dimensional or greater (capturing a vocabulary of 20,000 tokens, in this case). So, word embeddings pack more information into far fewer dimensions.\n",

    " - Load into our model word embeddings that were precomputed using a different machine-learning task than the one we’re trying to solve. These are called **pretrained word embeddings**.\n",
    " \n",
    "Let’s look at both.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### LEARNING WORD EMBEDDINGS WITH THE EMBEDDING LAYER\n",
    "The simplest way to associate a dense vector with a word is to choose the vector at random. The problem with this approach is that the resulting embedding space has no structure: for instance, the words *accurate* and *exact* may end up with completely\n",
    "different embeddings, even though they’re interchangeable in most sentences. It’s difficult for a deep neural network to make sense of such a noisy, unstructured embedding space.\n",
    "\n",
    "To get a bit more abstract, the geometric relationships between word vectors should reflect the semantic relationships between these words. Word embeddings are meant to map human language into a geometric space. For instance, in a reasonable\n",
    "embedding space, we would expect synonyms to be embedded into similar word vectors; and in general, we would expect the geometric distance (such as L2 distance) between any two word vectors to relate to the semantic distance between the associated\n",
    "words (words meaning different things are embedded at points far away from each other, whereas related words are closer). In addition to distance, we may want specific *directions* in the embedding space to be meaningful. To make this clearer, let’s\n",
    "look at a concrete example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Four words are embedded on a 2D plane: cat, dog, wolf, and tiger. With the vector representations we chose here, some semantic relationships between these words can be encoded as geometric transformations. For instance, the same vector allows us to go from cat to tiger and from dog to wolf : this vector could be interpreted as the “from pet to wild animal” vector. Similarly, another vector lets us go from dog to cat and from wolf to tiger, which could be interpreted as a “from canine to feline” vector.\n",

    "\n",
    "In real-world word-embedding spaces, common examples of meaningful geometric transformations are “gender” vectors and “plural” vectors. For instance, by adding a “female” vector to the vector “king,” we obtain the vector “queen.” By adding a “plural” vector, we obtain “kings.” Word-embedding spaces typically feature thousands of such interpretable and potentially useful vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Is there some ideal word-embedding space that would perfectly map human language and could be used for any natural-language-processing task? Possibly, but we have yet to compute anything of the sort. Also, there is no such a thing as *human language*—\n",
    "there are many different languages, and they aren’t isomorphic, because a language is the reflection of a specific culture and a specific context. But more pragmatically, what makes a good word-embedding space depends heavily on our task: the perfect word-embedding space for an English-language movie-review sentiment analysis model may look different from the perfect embedding space for an English language legal-document-classification model, because the importance of certain semantic relationships varies from task to task.\n",
    "\n",
